When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: When I want to share project with other then I need to create remote repository so that I can share it to Github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: For example if a developer made some changes in the GitHub repository. And you donâ€™t want to pull this manually to your local repository. So it is a good practice to pull changes manually instead of automatic up-to-date.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans: forks clones the others repo to my github repo without cloning it to locally. Cloning the forks will clone the forked repo that I clone from others and it will not effect the fork repo. When cloning the the repo it automatically created the origin branch.
